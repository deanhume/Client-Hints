# Service Workers and WebP Images
Images play an important role on the web today. Imagine a world without images on our web pages! This repo contains a basic example that uses the [Picture Element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-picture-element) and [Service Workers](https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker) to dynamically return [WebP Images](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/?hl=en).
